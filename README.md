# SearchUserOnGitHub

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

A simple web application for searching GitHub users written in NodeJS, Typescript and React.

My main goal with this project is to build an simple app for applying some architectural concepts heavily inspired on Robert C. Martin Clean 
Architecture. It is very similar to other implementations of Clean Architecture, but I'm
putting together some of my ideas about this architecture.
